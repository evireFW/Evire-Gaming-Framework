# Backend Development for Evire Applications

## Overview
The backend development toolkit includes APIs, SDKs and guidelines for building scalable and secure applications on the Evire blockchain.

## Key Areas
### 1. Identity Management
- **Decentralized Identity**: Use APIs for secure player authentication.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement additional layers of security.

### 2. Asset Management
- **Tokenization API**: APIs to create and manage in-game assets as NFTs.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Tools for integrating decentralized marketplaces.

### 3. Off-Chain Compute
Leverage Evire's compute nodes for intensive gaming logic:
```python
from evire_sdk import ComputeNode

compute = ComputeNode("testnet")
result = compute.execute("complex_game_logic", data)
```
